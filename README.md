# Project SISU

## Group project for Programming 3 (interfaces and techniques) -course in Tampere University. 

The objective of the assignment was to implement a Java application to track student's progress in their studies and to save them from the troubles of the infamous Sisu. The application has been implemented using JAva + JavaFX and Maven. 
The data of all the study programs, modules and courses is fetched from Sisu API.
