The aim of the project was to implement a Java application to track student's progress in their studies. 
The data of all the study programs, modules and courses is fetched from Sisu API and presented in a JavaFX UI. 


The user interface (consisting of App.java and PrimaryController.java),  was done by me, 
DegreeBuilder by Elisabet Dalskaja and rest of the classes by Miia Honkanen.
